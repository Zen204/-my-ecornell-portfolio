# Predicting Airbnb Availability

The project leverages feature engineering, data preprocessing, and supervised learning models to achieve accurate predictions.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing data, encodes categorical variables, and scales numerical features for optimal model performance.
- **Feature Engineering:** Extracts relevant features to improve prediction accuracy.
- **Modeling:** Trains and evaluates supervised learning models to predict behaviors.
- **Visualization:** Includes plots to analyze data trends and model performance.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

Install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/airbnb-availability-predictor.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd airbnb-availability-predictor
   ```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Listings_Availability.ipynb
   ```

4. Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to:

   - Load and preprocess the data
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
   - Train and evaluate machine learning models

## Results

The notebook provides:

- A detailed analysis of features impacting the models' ability to make predictions.
- Performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) of the trained models.
- Visualizations to understand data distribution and model predictions.
